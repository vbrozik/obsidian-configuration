# Obsidian configuration

This repository contains the configuration files which I use in most of my Obsidian vaults.

The content should be put directly to the `.obsidian` subdirectory of the vault directory.

## TODO

- [ ] Check the way community plugins should be installed.
- [ ] Check if the installed plugins will not overwrite their configuration files.
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook to check for sensitive data in the configuration files.
- [ ] Describe the goals of the configuration.
